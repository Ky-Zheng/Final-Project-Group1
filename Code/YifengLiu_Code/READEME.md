\f0\fs24 \cf0 Pytorch.py\
\
This python file is going to train a four CNN model in Pytorch. After running this script, the user will get a .pt file which stored their trained CNN model. Besides, user can also get training loss, training accuracy pictures and validation accuracy.\
\
In order to run this script successfully, there are two directories of loading data need to be changed by user. Furthermore, the user need to store different class of image data in the files named by their labels.\
\
train_dir = \'91/data_2/train'\
test_dir = '/data_2/test'\
\
Switching these two directories to user\'92s local train and test image data path and the user would be ready to run this .py file successfully.}
